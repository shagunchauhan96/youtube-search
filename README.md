# Youtube Search

A simple youtube search application, using the youtube v3 API.

To use, get an api key from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/), and put it in the app.js file.

This searches youtube based on the search query, the returned results are displayed in a card-like format, and are sortable based on the date of upload or name.
